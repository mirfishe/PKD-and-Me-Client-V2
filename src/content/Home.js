            <p>When someone discovers the work of Philip K. Dick and becomes fascinated by it, there is a phenomenon in which they must read all of his work as fast as possible. Sometimes the plots and incidents blur together into one mega-novel. And there are a lot of novels. It would be helpful for a person to have a checklist to mark the ones that theyâ€™ve read and the ability to enter what they thought of the novel.</p>

            <p>Plus the application would provide resources such as publication dates, covers and links to more information for an even deeper dive into the work.</p>
