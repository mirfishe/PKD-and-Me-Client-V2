Despite profoundly different approaches - one was a depth psychologist whose unique insights and approach to psychology forced him to explore the depths of the unconscious in a way that inevitably led him to touch frequently on metaphysical or spiritual matters; the other was an author of science-fiction - there are some striking parallels between their unique Gnostic visions.\n\nWith the relatively recent publication of both Jung's and Dick's personal journals - The Red Book (2009), and, The Exegesis of Philip K.

Dick didn’t predict the future― he summoned the desperate bleakness of our present directly from his fevered paranoia. Dick didn’t predict the Internet or iPhones or email or 3D printers, but rather he so thoroughly understood human nature that he could already see, even at the advent of the transistor, the way technology would alienate us from each other and from ourselves. He could see us isolated and drifting in our own private realities even before we had plugged in our ear buds. He could see, even in the earliest days of space exploration, how much of our own existence remained unexplored, and how the great black spaces between people were growing even as our universe was shrinking.\n\nPhilip K. Dick spent his first three years as a science fiction author writing shorter fiction, and in his lifetime he composed almost 150 short stories, many of which have gone on to be adapted into (slightly watered down) Hollywood blockbusters. Collected here are thirteen of his most Dickian tales, funhouse realities with trap doors and hidden compartments, the literary equivalent of optical illusions, tricks of perspective.","urlPKDweb":"","active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:31.269Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-26T22:52:16.355Z","category":{"categoryID":2,"category":"Short Story Collections","sortID":2,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":199,"titleName":"Blade Runner","titleSort":"blade runner","titleURL":"Blade-Runner-Video-Game","authorFirstName":null,"authorLastName":"Westwood Studios","publicationDate":"1997-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","imageName":"https://philipdick.com/images/covers/BladeRunnerVideoGame.jpg","categoryID":11,"shortDescription":"In 1997 Westwood Studios released a title that won universal praise from gamers and critics all around the world, along with accolades like AIAS’s Adventure Game of the Year award.

Both films have been widely hailed as among the greatest science-fiction movies of all time, and Ridley Scott, director of the original Blade Runner, has announced that there will be a third Blade Runner movie.\n\n\nBlade Runner 2049 and Philosophy is a collection of entertaining articles on both Blade Runner movies (and on the spin-off short films and Blade Runner novels) by twenty philosophers representing diverse backgrounds and philosophical perspectives. Among the issues addressed in the book:\n\n\n\nWhat does Blade Runner 2049 tell us about the interactions of state power and corporate power?\n\nCan machines ever become truly conscious, or will they always lack some essential human qualities?\n\nThe most popular theory of personhood says that a person is defined by their memories, so what happens when memories can be manufactured and inserted at will?\n\nWe already interact with non-human decision-makers via the Internet. When embodied AI becomes reality, how can we know what is human and what is simulation? Does it matter?\n\nDo AI-endowed human-looking replicants have civil and political rights, or can they be destroyed whenever “real” humans decide they are inconvenient?\n\nThe blade runner Deckard (Harrison Ford) appears in both movies, and is generally assumed to be human, but some claim he may be a replicant. What’s the evidence on both sides?\n\nIs Niander Wallace (the-mad-scientist-cum-evil-corporate-CEO in Blade Runner 2049) himself a replicant? What motivates him?\n\nWhat are the impacts of decision-making AI entities on the world of business?\n\nBoth Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049 have been praised for their hauntingly beautiful depictions of a bleak future, but the two futures are very different (and the 2019 future imagined in the original Blade Runner is considerably different from the actual world of 2019). How have our expectations and visions of the future changed between the two movies?\n\nThe “dream maker” character Ana Stelline in Blade Runner 2049 has a small but pivotal role. What are the implications of a person whose dedicated mission and task is to invent and install false memories?\n\nWhat are the social and psychological implications of human-AI sexual relations?","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-28T16:35:18.421Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T17:37:15.551Z","category":{"categoryID":5,"category":"Blade Runner","sortID":5,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":146,"titleName":"Blade Runner 2049: A Philosophical Exploration","titleSort":"blade runner 2049: a philosophical exploration","titleURL":"Blade-Runner-2049-A-Philosophical-Exploration","authorFirstName":"Timothy Shanahan,","authorLastName":"Paul Smart","publicationDate":"2019-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","imageName":"https://philipdick.com/images/covers/BladeRunner2049APhilosophicalExploration.jpg","categoryID":5,"shortDescription":"Widely acclaimed upon its release as a future classic, Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049 is visually stunning, philosophically profound, and a provocative extension of the story in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner.

Dick, which include the classic movie Blade Runner, the Arnold Schwarzenegger actioner Total Recall, Minority Report, directed by Steven Spielberg, and 2007’s Next. A thorough exploration of Blade Runner forms the core of the book, looking at the conception, production, themes and influence of the 1982 Warner Brothers film in every detail. Philip Kindred Dick (1928-1982) was a key figure in 20th century science fiction, famous for embracing drugs and the counter-culture in his work. Dick's fiction includes The Man In the High Castle, Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said, A Scanner Darkly, The Game Players of Titan, Clan of the Alphane Moon, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Valis, The Divine Invasion, Martian Time-Slip, The Minority Report, and We Can Remember It For You Wholesale. Dick's themes included perception and reality, drugs, state control, global capitalism, surveillance, and paranoia. Four films are explored here: Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report and A Scanner Darkly (in a chapter by Thomas Christie). The other films based on Phil Dick's fiction, which are discussed in the final chapter, include Confessions d'un Barjo (a French movie based on Confessions of a Crap Artist), a Canadian film, Screamers, based on Dick's Second Variety story, Paycheck, directed by John Woo, Next (Lee Tamahori, 2007), based on The Golden Man, and Impostor (Gary Fleder, 2002). The more recent cycle of Philip Kindred Dick movies began with Minority Report and Impostor in 2002 - Paycheck and Next followed in 2003 and 2007, and The Owl In Daylight, a possible film about Dick, Radio Free Alemuth (2008), and The Adjustment Bureau in 2011. A sequel to Screamers was released in 2009, again shooting in Canada. A striking aspect of the films made from the fiction of Philip K. Dick is how many are very high budget movies (Paycheck, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Next and Total Recall), and just how many high profile filmmakers have been attracted to Dick's stories: Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven, John Woo and the most successful film director of recent times, Steven Spielberg. Those four directors together have generated billions globally. Fully illustrated, with a newly revised text for this edition. Bibliography, filmography and notes. ISBN 971861713568. Also available in hardback www.crmoon.com FROM THE FOREWORD: In this comprehensive book, Jeremy Robinson explores the themes of Blade Runner with his usual insight and knowledge of visual and narrative film. Robinson presents a critical and objective outside viewpoint. He tries to be balanced, and to offer criticism as well as praise. It is ultimately important to note that he is writing about art, not the artist, and he admires Ridley Scott as much as I do. Blade Runner has been analyzed, debated, dissected and discussed extensively over the last 25 years and I hope you find Jeremy Robinson's exploration into Ridley Scott's seminal sci-fi film noir masterpiece to be innovative and glowing with new ideas that stimulate your imagination and jump start your synapses.

Dick's novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, combines noir with science fiction to create a groundbreaking cyberpunk vision of urban life in the twenty-first century. With replicants on the run, the rain-drenched Los Angeles which Blade Runner imagines is a city of oppression and enclosure, but a city in which transgression and disorder can always erupt. Graced by stunning sets, lighting, effects, costumes and photography, Blade Runner succeeds brilliantly in depicting a world at once uncannily familiar and startlingly new. In his innovative and nuanced reading, Scott Bukatman details the making of Blade Runner and its steadily improving fortunes following its release in 1982. He situates the film in terms of debates about postmodernism, which have informed much of the criticism devoted to it, but argues that its tensions derive also from the quintessentially twentieth-century, modernist experience of the city – as a space both imprisoning and liberating.\n In his foreword to this special edition, published to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the BFI Film Classics series, Bukatman suggests that Blade Runner 's visual complexity allows it to translate successfully to the world of high definition and on-demand home cinema. He looks back to the sciencefiction tradition of the early 1980s, and on to the key changes in the 'final' version of the film in 2007, which risk diminishing the sense of instability created in the original.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-28T14:58:14.799Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-04T00:35:20.094Z","category":{"categoryID":5,"category":"Blade Runner","sortID":5,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":123,"titleName":"Blade Runner Creator Philip K.

Humans live alongside replicants, and they buy virtual friends to combat loneliness. Behind the slick facade of brightly lit animated billboards, many people live in poverty in the future city of Los Angeles, which reflects the state of things today. The story began with a novel by an obscure science fiction author who lived in poverty for most of his life. His dark vision of the future became widely known after Ridley Scott's Blade Runner was released in 1982, but sadly Philip K. Dick died before the film was shown in theatres.

Set in a dystopian future where the line between human beings and ‘replicants’ is blurred, the film raises a host of philosophical questions about what it is to be human, the possibility of moral agency and freedom in ‘created’ life forms, and the capacity of cinema to make a genuine contribution to our engagement with these kinds of questions.\n\nThis volume of specially commissioned chapters systematically explores and addresses these issues from a philosophical point of view. Beginning with a helpful introduction, the seven chapters examine the following questions:\n\n How is the theme of death explored in Blade Runner and with what implications for our understanding of the human condition?\n What can we learn about the relationship between emotion and reason from the depiction of the ‘replicants’ in Blade Runner?\n How are memory, empathy, and moral agency related in Blade Runner?\n How does the style and ‘mood’ of Blade Runner bear upon its thematic and philosophical significance?\n Is Blade Runner a meditation on the nature of film itself?\n\nIncluding a brief biography of the director and a detailed list of references to other writings on the film, Blade Runner is essential reading for students – indeed anyone - interested in philosophy and film studies.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-28T17:08:04.239Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-04T00:34:33.604Z","category":{"categoryID":5,"category":"Blade Runner","sortID":5,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":131,"titleName":"Blade Runner: Screenplay","titleSort":"blade runner: screenplay","titleURL":"Blade-Runner-Screenplay","authorFirstName":"Terrence","authorLastName":"Ryan","publicationDate":"2020-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","imageName":"https://philipdick.com/images/covers/BladeRunnerScreenplay.jpg","categoryID":5,"shortDescription":"Deckard (Harrison Ford) is forced by the police Boss (M.

No stone is left unturned—and no gooey mess unstepped in—in this essential study of Dank's all-too-brief existence and all-too-extensive oeuvre.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-11-07T21:02:09.003Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-07T21:02:09.003Z","category":{"categoryID":19,"category":"Homages","sortID":19,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-11-06T14:58:50.585Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-06T14:58:50.585Z"}},{"titleID":2,"titleName":"Clans of the Alphane Moon","titleSort":"clans of the alphane moon","titleURL":"Clans-Of-The-Alphane-Moon","authorFirstName":"Philip K.","authorLastName":"Dick","publicationDate":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","imageName":"https://philipdick.com/images/covers/ClansOfTheAlphaneMoon.jpg","categoryID":1,"shortDescription":"On a planet run by escapees from a mental institution, the doctors who arrive to restore order may be the craziest of all.\n\nFor years, the third moon in the Alphane system was used as a psychiatric hospital.

Based on the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by the acclaimed novelist Philip K. Dick and directed by Ridley Scott, Blade Runner was a visual and philosophical tour-de-force, set in a dystopian future in which artificially intelligent replicants, nearly indistinguishable from humans, are hunted down by police-operatives known as Blade Runners. Featuring the talents of Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Joanna Cassidy, Edward James Olmos, and Darryl Hannah, the film tackled numerous themes and birthed controversies that have been poured over by fans and critics ever since. Blade Runner has also inspired literary and comic-book spin-offs, and a cinematic sequel released in 2017. The Cyberpunk Nexus: Exploring the Blade Runner Universe examines the entire Blade Runner saga, from the original novel to its numerous film iterations. The book features a foreword by Paul M. Sammon (Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner). Essayists include Bryce Carlson (of BOOM! Comics’ Sheep adaptation), Paul J. Salamoff, Robert Meyer Burnett, Rich Handley, Zaki Hasan, Julian Darius, and many others, with a cover by popular artist Matt Busch. From Sequart Organization.

Dick's writings a rare quality stands out: a deep human and intellectual honesty, almost an inability to hide behind his work, revealing himself rather through it. Dick's trust in his readers was absolute, unparalleled among fellow science fiction writers. A trust that is not at all misplaced. because they were the one who kept the interest in all his production alive, even for the realistic texts that the publishing of his time had rejected. With \"The Dark-Haired Girl\" Dick wanted to share with those who would read him the inner torment following the breakup of his marriage, at a time of great uncertainty about his personal future. This openness goes beyond a simple admission of fragility. Interpreting his thoughts, experiences and dreams, the great writer hopes to better understand what distinguishes the human from the simulacrum, man from the machine. The result is a book that establishes a surprising and penetrating connection between his art and the events of his life.

But to worship the man, they need an image of him as a god, and no one has ever seen him. So the high priests send a limbless master painter named Tibor McMasters into the wilderness on a mission to find Lufteufel and capture his likeness. Unfortunately for Tibor, the nation’s remaining Christians do not want him to succeed and are willing to kill to ensure that the so-called Deus Irae remains hidden.

Dick helped to shape science fiction into the popular genre it is today. His stories, renowned for their sophisticated philosophical themes and startling portrayals of simulated realities, inspired numerous television and film adaptations, including the 1982 cult classic Blade Runner.\n\nDick's personal life took on an otherwordly quality when, in 1974, he famously had a series of bizarre visions. According to Dick, a pink light beamed psychic information into his brain, awakening memories of a past life as an ancient Christian revolutionary and granting him contact with time-traveling extraterrestrials. He witnessed scenes from ancient Rome superimposed over his California neighborhood, and warned local police he was a dangerous machine programmed to self-destruct. After the visions faded, Philip K. Dick spent the rest of his life trying to fathom the meaning of what he called his \"divine madness.\" Was it schizophrenia? Or a genuine religious experience?\n\nIn The Divine Madness of Philip K. Dick, clinical psychologist Kyle Arnold probes the fascinating mystery of Dick's heart and mind, and shows readers how early traumas opened Dick to profound spiritual experiences while also predisposing him toward drug dependency and violence. Disputing the myth that Dick had schizophrenia, Arnold contends that Dick's well-known paranoia was caused by his addiction to speed. Despite Dick's paranoia, his divine madness was not a sign of mental illness, but a powerful spiritual experience conveyed in the images of science fiction.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-23T13:27:30.652Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-29T14:29:04.724Z","category":{"categoryID":14,"category":"Biographies","sortID":14,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-29T14:25:59.128Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-29T14:25:59.128Z"}},{"titleID":9,"titleName":"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?","titleSort":"do androids dream of electric sheep?","titleURL":"Do-Androids-Dream-Of-Electric-Sheep","authorFirstName":"Philip K.","authorLastName":"Dick","publicationDate":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","imageName":"https://philipdick.com/images/covers/DoAndroidsDreamOfElectricSheep.jpg","categoryID":1,"shortDescription":"A masterpiece ahead of its time, a prescient rendering of a dark future, and the inspiration for the blockbuster film Blade Runner\n\nBy 2021, the World War has killed millions, driving entire species into extinction and sending mankind off-planet.

Edited and introduced by Pamela Jackson and Jonathan Lethem, this is the definitive presentation of Dick’s brilliant, and epic, work.\n\nIn the Exegesis, Dick documents his eight-year attempt to fathom what he called “2-3-74,” a postmodern visionary experience of the entire universe “transformed into information.” In entries that sometimes ran to hundreds of pages, in a freewheeling voice that ranges through personal confession, esoteric scholarship, dream accounts, and fictional fugues, Dick tried to write his way into the heart of a cosmic mystery that tested his powers of imagination and invention to the limit.\nThis volume, the culmination of many years of transcription and archival research, has been annotated by the editors and by a unique group of writers and scholars chosen to offer a range of views into one of the most improbable and mind-altering manuscripts ever brought to light.","urlPKDweb":"","active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:31.269Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T01:08:58.363Z","category":{"categoryID":3,"category":"Non Fiction","sortID":3,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":12,"titleName":"Eye in the Sky","titleSort":"eye in the sky","titleURL":"Eye-In-The-Sky","authorFirstName":"Philip K.","authorLastName":"Dick","publicationDate":"1957-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","imageName":"https://philipdick.com/images/covers/EyeInTheSky.jpg","categoryID":1,"shortDescription":"“I have never seen [its] theme handled with greater technical dexterity or given more psychological meaning.”—Fantasy and Science Fiction\n\nWhen a routine tour of a particle accelerator goes awry, Jack Hamilton and the rest of his tour group find themselves in a world ruled by Old Testament morality, where the smallest infraction can bring about a plague of locusts.

Dick: Four Novels of the 1960s, edited by Jonathan Lethem. Now comes a companion volume collecting five novels that offer a breathtaking overview of the range of this science-fiction master.\n\nPhilip K. Dick (1928-82) was a writer of incandescent imagination who made and unmade world-systems with ferocious rapidity and unbridled speculative daring. \"The floor joists of the universe,\" he once wrote, \"are visible in my novels.\" Martian Time-Slip (1964) unfolds on a parched and thinly colonized Red Planet where schizophrenia is a contagion and the unscrupulous seek to profit from a troubled child's time-fracturing visions. Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb (1965) chronicles the deeply-interwoven stories of a multi-racial community of survivors, including the scientist who may have been responsible for World War III. Famous, among other reasons, for a therapy session involving a talking taxicab, Now Wait for Last Year (1966) explores the effects of JJ-180, a hallucinogen that alters not only perception, but reality. In Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said (1974), a television star seeks to unravel a mystery that has left him stripped of his identity. A Scanner Darkly (1977), the basis for the 2006 film, envisions a drug-addled world in which a narcotics officer's tenuous hold on sanity is strained by his new surveillance assignment: himself. Mixing metaphysics and madness, phantasmagoric visions of a post-nuclear world and invading extraterrestrial authoritarians, and all-too-real evocations of the drugged-out America of the 70s, Dick's work remains exhilarating and unsettling in equal measure.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-20T15:10:38.102Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T01:35:06.950Z","category":{"categoryID":1,"category":"Novels","sortID":1,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":13,"titleName":"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said","titleSort":"flow my tears, the policeman said","titleURL":"Flow-My-Tears-The-Policeman-Said","authorFirstName":"Philip K.","authorLastName":"Dick","publicationDate":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","imageName":"https://philipdick.com/images/covers/FlowMyTearsThePolicemanSaid.jpg","categoryID":1,"shortDescription":"\"Dick skillfully explores the psychological ramifications of this nightmare.\"—The New York Times Review of Books\n\nFlow My Tears, the Policeman Said grapples with many of the themes Philip K.

Dick is now seen as a uniquely visionary figure, a writer who, in editor Jonathan Lethem’s words, “wielded a sardonic yet heartbroken acuity about the plight of being alive in the twentieth century, one that makes him a lonely hero to the readers who cherish him.”\n\nThis Library of America volume brings together four of Dick’s most original novels. The Man in the High Castle (1962), which won the Hugo Award, describes an alternate world in which Japan and Germany have won World War II and America is divided into separate occupation zones. The dizzying The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (1965) posits a future in which competing hallucinogens proffer different brands of virtual reality, and an interplanetary drug tycoon can transform himself into a godlike figure transcending even physical death.\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968), about a bounty hunter in search of escaped androids in a postapocalyptic society where status is measured by the possession of live animals and religious life is focused on a television personality, was the basis for the movie Blade Runner. Ubik (1969), with its future world of psychic espionage agents and cryonically frozen patients inhabiting an illusory “half-life,” pursues Dick’s theme of simulated realities and false perceptions to ever more disturbing conclusions, as time collapses on itself and characters stranded in past eras search desperately for the elusive, constantly shape-shifting panacea Ubik. As with most of Dick’s novels, no plot summary can suggest the mesmerizing and constantly surprising texture of these astonishing books.\n\nPosing the questions “What is human?” and “What is real?” in a multitude of fascinating ways, Dick produced works—fantastic and weird, yet developed with precise logic, marked by wild humor and soaring flights of religious speculation—that are startlingly prescient imaginative anticipations of twenty-first-century quandaries.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-20T15:12:00.648Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T01:36:00.695Z","category":{"categoryID":1,"category":"Novels","sortID":1,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":96,"titleName":"Future Imperfect: Philip K.

These three authors changed the way millions of readers thought, dreamed, and experienced reality―but how did their writings reflect, as well as shape, the seismic cultural shifts taking place in America?\n\nIn High Weirdness, Erik Davis―America's leading scholar of high strangeness―examines the published and unpublished writings of these vital, iconoclastic thinkers, as well as their own life-changing mystical experiences. Davis explores the complex lattice of the strange that flowed through America's West Coast at a time of radical technological, political, and social upheaval to present a new theory of the weird as a viable mode for a renewed engagement with reality.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-28T01:48:30.766Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T01:48:30.766Z","category":{"categoryID":4,"category":"Secondary Resources","sortID":4,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":98,"titleName":"How Much Does Chaos Scare You?: Politics, Religion, and Philosophy in the Fiction of Philip K.

In it was a fully functional head of the android replica of Philip K. Dick, cult science-fiction writer and counterculture guru. It has never been recovered.\n\nIn a story that echoes some of the most paranoid fantasies of a Dick novel, readers get a fascinating inside look at the scientists and technology that made this amazing android possible. The author, who was a fellow researcher at the University of Memphis Institute of Intelligent Systems while the android was being built, introduces readers to the cutting-edge technology in robotics, artificial intelligence, and sculpture that came together in this remarkable machine and captured the imagination of scientists, artists, and science-fiction fans alike. And there are great stories about Dick himself―his inspired yet deeply pessimistic worldview, his bizarre lifestyle, and his enduring creative legacy.

Rickels often found himself compared to novelist Philip K. Dick—though in fact Rickels had never read any of the science fiction writer’s work. When he finally read his first Philip K.

The result of this engagement is I Think I Am: Philip K. Dick, a profound thought experiment that charts the wide relevance of the pulp sci-fi author and paranoid visionary. I Think I Am: Philip K. Dick explores the science fiction author’s meditations on psychic reality and psychosis, Christian mysticism, Eastern religion, and modern spiritualism. Covering all of Dick’s science fiction, Rickels corrects the lack of scholarly interest in the legendary Californian author and, ultimately, makes a compelling case for the philosophical and psychoanalytic significance of Philip K.

Dick . . .\n\nTOTAL RECALL – BLADE RUNNER – THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU\n\nBut what you probably didn’t know is that their creator was living out some of the same incredibly bizarre scenarios that he wrote about. One can easily compare Philip to the character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger in “Total Recall,” who found himself in a parallel universe on a faraway planet, despite the fact that he was only supposed to be hooked up in a laboratory to a machine that creates realistic dream-like images. Which reality is the character really living in?\n\nAt a sci-fi press conference held in France in 1977, Philip tried to explain some of his bewildering thoughts about the existence of a parallel or self-contained – Matrix-like – universe created by “someone” who has the ability to alter the course of time and our concept of reality:\n\n“People claim to remember past lives,” Philip told the throng of reporters and fans. “I claim to remember a different – very different – present life. I know of nobody who has ever made this claim before but I rather suspect that my experience is not unique. What perhaps is unique is my willingness to talk about it. We are living in a computer-programmed reality and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed and some alteration in our reality occurs . . . and because of this a variable WAS changed – reprogrammed as it were – and an alternative world branched off.”\n\nDrawing on the masterful mind of creative genius Philip K. Dick we offer up dozens of his personal experiences, as well as those of others in the UFO and paranormal fields, where synchronicities seem to abound. This is NOT science fiction. This is a universe that cannot be so easily grasped or explained.\n\nThe well-known collector of scientific curiosities, Charles Fort, is often quoted as having said: “The Earth is a farm. We are someone’s property.” He likened our condition to being movable pieces on a chess board.\n\n“There is no doubt that we are under some sort of surveillance and that an ‘invisible hand’ has the ability to carve out our existence and ‘interfere’ in our daily lives by creating a variety of bizarre ‘play scripts’ that to some may seem like pure ‘coincidences.’” Or so says pop culture paranormalist Tim Beckley, who notes that “Synchronicities are not just random occurrences but are laid out before us by some sort of synchronicity command post, which ably demonstrates their mastery or control over us hapless earthlings.”\n\nDrawing on the masterful mind of creative genius Philip K. Dick (some to this day perceive him to have been a total “mad man”) we offer up dozens of his personal experiences, as well as those of others in the UFO and paranormal fields, where synchronicities seem to abound. Beckley and co-author Sean Casteel lay out a plausible scenario to “explain” the intricate workings of what has been dubbed “The Synchronicity Command Board,” or “Earth Coincidence Control Office,” as so aptly named by the brilliant American marine biologist and neurologist, Dr. John C. Lilly.\n\nTHE MATRIX CONTROL SYSTEM OF PHILIP K.

His career boasts an incredible array of projects from designing cars to drafting architectural renderings, but he is most famous for his work as a concept artist on some of the most visually arresting films in the history of cinema. Since working on Star Trek: The Motion Picture in 1978 as a production illustrator Syd Mead has always aimed to render “reality ahead of schedule,” creating evocative designs that marry believable content with a neofuturistic form. It is this ability to predict technological potential that has helped Mead create such a distinctive and influential aesthetic. From his work with Ridley Scott on Blade Runner, to his striking designs for the light cycles in Tron, to his imposing concept art for the U.S.S. Sulaco in James Cameron’s Aliens, Syd Mead has played a pivotal role in shaping cinema’s vision of the future. \n\n\nThe Movie Art of Syd Mead: Visual Futurist represents the most extensive collection of Mead’s visionary work ever printed, compiling hundreds of images, sketches and concept arts from a career spanning almost 40 years, many of which have never been seen in print before. Each entry provides a unique insight into the processes involved in Mead’s practice as well as illuminating the behind-the-scenes work involved in creating a fully realized, cinematic depiction of the future.

In the 1950s, random acts of possession begin to occur. Ordinary men, women, and children are the targets of entities that seem to spring from the depths of the collective unconscious, pop-cultural avatars some call demons. There’s the Truth, implacable avenger of falsehood. The Captain, brave and self-sacrificing soldier. The Little Angel, whose kiss brings death, whether desired or not. And a string of others, ranging from the bizarre to the benign to the horrific.\n\nAs a boy, Del Pierce is possessed by the Hellion, an entity whose mischief-making can be deadly. With the help of Del’s family and a caring psychiatrist, the demon is exorcised . . . or is it? Years later, following a car accident, the Hellion is back, trapped inside Del’s head and clamoring to get out.\n\nDel’s quest for help leads him to Valis, an entity possessing the science fiction writer formerly known as Philip K. Dick; to Mother Mariette, a nun who inspires decidedly unchaste feelings; and to the Human League, a secret society devoted to the extermination of demons. All believe that Del holds the key to the plague of possession–and its solution. But for Del, the cure may be worse than the disease.\n\n“Look out, Lethem!

Dick (1928-1982) is the giant imagination behind so much recent popular culture--both movies directly based on his writings, such as Blade Runner (based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?), Total Recall, Minority Report, and The Adjustment Bureau plus cult favorites such as A Scanner Darkly, Imposter, Next, Screamers, and Paycheck and works revealing his powerful influence, such as The Matrix and Inception. With the much anticipated forthcoming publication in 2011 of volume 1 of Exegesis, his journal of spiritual visions and paranoic investigations, Dick is fast becoming a major influence in the world of popular spirituality and occult thinking.\n\nIn Philip K. Dick and Philosophy: Do Androids have Kindred Spirits?, thirty-four Dick fans and professional thinkers confront the fascinating and frightening ideas raised by Dick's mind-blowing fantasies. Is there an alien world behind the everyday reality we experience? If androids can pass as human, should they be given the same consideration as humans? Do psychotics have insights into a mystical reality? Would knowledge of the future free us or enslave us? This volume also includes two Dick short stories: \"Beyond Lies the Wub,\" and \"The Eyes Have It.\"\n\nPhilip K. Dick and Philosophy explores the ideas of Philip K. Dick in the same way that he did: with an earnest desire to understand the truth of the world, but without falsely equating earnestness with a dry seriousness. Dick's work was replete with whimsical and absurdist presentations of the greatest challenges to reason and to humanity--paradox, futility, paranoia, and failure--and even at his darkest times he was able to keep some perspective and humor, as for example in choosing to name himself 'Horselover Fat' in VALIS at the same time as he relates his personal religious epiphanies, crises, and delusions. With the same earnest whimsy, we approach Philip K. Dick as a philosopher like ourselves--one who wrote almost entirely in thought-experiments and semi-fictional world-building, but who engaged with many of the greatest questions of philosophy throughout the Euro-American tradition.\n\nPhilip K. Dick and Philosophy has much to offer for both serious fans who have read many of his novels and stories, and for those who may have just recently learned his name and realized that his work has been the inspiration for several well-known and thought-provoking films. Most chapters start with one or more of the movies based on Dick's writing. From here, the authors delve deeper into the issues by bringing in philosophers' perspectives and by bringing in Dick's written work. The book invites the reader with a casual familiarity with Dick to get to know his work, and invites the reader with little familiarity with philosophy to learn more. At the same time, we have new perspectives and challenging connections and interpretations for even the most hard-core Dick fans, even though we never speak to \"insiders\" only.\n\nThe book prominently addresses the most widely-known films: Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, and The Adjustment Bureau. Along with these \"big five\" films, a few chapters address his last novels, especially VALIS, which have a significant cult following of their own. There are also chapters which address short stories and novels which are currently planned for adaptation: Radio Free Albemuth (film completed, awaiting distribution), The Man in the High Castle (in development by Ridley Scott for BBC mini-series), and \"King of the Elves\" (Disney, planned for release in 2013).","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-28T00:17:09.552Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-04T00:32:39.469Z","category":{"categoryID":4,"category":"Secondary Resources","sortID":4,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":115,"titleName":"Philip K.

Evaluating five novels that span Dick's career--from Martian Time Slip (1964) to Valis (1981)--Kucukalic explores the the intersections of identity, narrative, and technology in order to ask two central, but uncharted \"Dickian\" questions: What is reality? and What is human?","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-23T14:46:59.788Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-23T14:47:18.846Z","category":{"categoryID":4,"category":"Secondary Resources","sortID":4,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":85,"titleName":"The Philip K.

The essays reveal the extent to which Philip K. Dick's personal obsessions pre-figured postmodernist concerns with humanity's self-alienation, cultural and personal paranoia, and the politics of simulation, deceit, and self-deception. The contributors reveal how Dick's ontological concerns, stated in his repeated questioning of What is real?, are also political concerns. Thus, they examine the philosophical and religious foundations on which his work rests, offering much-needed arguments which reveal both his philosophical depth and the extent to which he drew from esoteric and occult religions. His cultural critique also receives significant exposition, as the contributors reveal how Dick's fiction enacts the larger cultural struggles of cold war America, with its conflicting private visions and public realities, and its personal and political loyalties. The contributors argue for the significance of heretofore neglected or marginalized texts of Dick as well, including in their discussions many early short stories from the early 1950s and neglected novels of the mid-1960s, arguing that there is a need to understand how Dick shaped (or misshaped) his fictions so as to reimagine the life of his society.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-27T21:42:48.768Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T21:42:48.768Z","category":{"categoryID":4,"category":"Secondary Resources","sortID":4,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":157,"titleName":"Philip K.

His works speak to contemporary fears of being continually watched by technology, and the paranoia of modern life in which we watch ourselves and lose our sense of identity. Since his death in 1982, Dick's writing remain frighteningly relevant to 21st century audiences. Dick spent his life in near poverty and it was only after his death that he gained popular and critical recognition.

Concentrating both on recent critical studies and on reassessing his legacy in light of his new status as a \"major American author,\" these essays explore, just what happened culturally and critically to precipitate his extraordinary rise in reputation.

Philip K Dick: Exhilaration and Terror of the Postmodern examines a wide range of Dick's work, including his short stories and posthumously published realist novels. Christopher Palmer analyses the puzzling and dazzling effects of Dick's fiction, and argues that at its heart is a clash between exhilarating possibilities of transformation, and a frightening lack of ethical certainties.

Dick (1928-1982) have inspired fourteen feature films and four television series, none of which he ever saw. Many of them have been widely seen and highly influential; they include Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, The Man in the High Castle and most recently Blade Runner 2049 and Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams. Borrowing his inspired ideas, few of them really utilise the author's unique imagination and the thought behind them. This book reviews all of the above films and television shows from, as much as possible, the perspective of Philip Dick himself. For most of his life a housebound scrivener of pulp science fiction, Dick nonetheless had distinct ideas about movies, and how his work should be filmed. This book incorporates his thought about visual media into a study of how a commercial system of film production grinds an insomniac's electric sheep into sausages for the masses--some of them, it must be granted, rather tasty. Like Philip K. Dick, Gregg Rickman likes cats, has spent most of his life in California, and will stay up all night writing. Unlike Philip Dick, he doesn't take snuff and is not a visionary genius.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-30T03:16:03.857Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-30T03:16:03.857Z","category":{"categoryID":4,"category":"Secondary Resources","sortID":4,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":245,"titleName":"Philip K.

Perhaps best-known for Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, he embodied the counterculture a decade before the 1960s.

Dick explores the deep affinity between two seemingly quite different thinkers, in their attempts to address the need for salvation in (and from) an era of accelerated mechanization, in which humans' capacity for destroying or subjugating the living has attained a planetary scale.\n\nThe philosopher and the science fiction writer come together to meet the contradictory imperatives of a realist outlook-a task which, arguably, philosophy and science fiction could only ever adequately undertake in collaboration. Their respective approaches meet in a focus on the ambiguous status of fictionalizing, or fabulation, as simultaneously one of mechanization's most devastating tools, and the possibility of its undoing.\n\nWhen they are read together, the complexities and paradoxes thrown up by this ambiguity, with which both Bergson and Dick struggle on their own, open up new ways to navigate ideas of mechanism and mysticism, immanence and transcendence, and the possibility and meaning of salvation. The result is at once an original reading of both thinkers, a new critical theory of the socio–cultural, political and ethical function of fictionalizing, and a case study in the strange affinity, at times the uncanny similarity, between philosophy and science fiction.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-29T01:56:19.272Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-29T01:56:19.272Z","category":{"categoryID":4,"category":"Secondary Resources","sortID":4,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":116,"titleName":"Pink Beam: A Philip K.

Everything was silent, dead. Only the gun showed signs of life . . . and the trespassers had wrecked that for all time. The return journey to pick up the treasure would be a cinch . . . they smiled.\n\nTHE SKULL\n\nConger agreed to kill a stranger he had never seen. But he would make no mistakes because he had the stranger's skull under his arm.\n\nTHE DEFENDERS\n\nNo weapon has ever been frightful enough to put a stop to war -- perhaps because we never before had any that thought for themselves!\n\nMR. SPACESHIP\n\nA human brain-controlled spacecraft would mean mechanical perfection. This was accomplished, and something unforeseen: a strange entity called --\n\nTHE PIPER IN THE WOODS\n\nEarth maintained an important garrison on Asteroid Y-3. Now suddenly it was imperiled with a biological impossibility -- men becoming plants!\n\nSECOND VARIETY\n\nThe claws were bad enough in the first place -- nasty, crawling little death-robots. But when they began to imitate their creators, it was time for the human race to make peace -- if it could!\n\nTHE EYES HAVE IT\n\nA little whimsy, now and then, makes for good balance. Theoretically, you could find this type of humor anywhere. But only a topflight science-fictionist, we thought, could have written this story, in just this way....\n\nTHE VARIABLE MAN\n\nHe fixed things -- clocks, refrigerators, vidsenders and destinies. But he had no business in the future, where the calculators could not handle him. He was Earth's only hope -- and its sure failure!\n\nTHE HANGING STRANGER\n\nEd had always been a practical man, when he saw something wrong he tried to correct it. Then one day he saw IT hanging in the town square.\n\nTONY AND THE BEETLES\n\nA ten-year-old boy grows up fast when history catches up with the human race.\n\nBEYOND THE DOOR\n\nLarry Thomas bought a cuckoo clock for his wife -- without knowing the price he would have to pay.\n\nDid you ever wonder at the lonely life the bird in the cuckoo clock has to lead--that it might possibly love and hate just as easily as a real animal of flesh and blood? Philip Dick used that idea for this brief fantasy tale. We're sure that after reading it you'll give cuckoo clocks more respect.\n\nTHE CRYSTAL CRYPT\n\nTerror was rampant on the final Mars-Earth run. For black-clad Leiters were on the prowl ... and the grim red planet was not far behind.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:27:17.079Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-26T23:33:18.130Z","category":{"categoryID":2,"category":"Short Story Collections","sortID":2,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":194,"titleName":"PKD: A Phillip K.

Dick. In The Postmodern Humanism of Philip K. Dick, Jason Vest explores the work of this prolific, subversive, and mordantly funny science-fiction writer. He examines how Dick adapted the conventions of science fiction and postmodernism to reflect humanist concerns about the difficulties of maintaining identity, agency, and autonomy in the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nIn addition to an extensive analysis of the novel Now Wait for Last Year, Vest makes intellectually provocative comparisons between Dick and the works of Franz Kafka, Jorge Luis Borges, and Italo Calvino. He offers a detailed examination of Dick's literary relationship to all three authors, illuminating similarities between Dick and Kafka that have not previously been discussed, as well as similarities between Dick and Borges that scholars frequently note but fail to explore in detail.\n\nLike Kafka, Borges, and Calvino, Dick employs fantastic, unreal, and visionary fiction to reflect the disruptions, dislocations, and depressing realities of twentieth-century life. By comparing him to these other writers, Vest demonstrates that Dick's fiction is a fascinating barometer of postmodern American life even as it participates in an international tradition of visionary literature.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-28T00:30:38.248Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T00:32:57.491Z","category":{"categoryID":4,"category":"Secondary Resources","sortID":4,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":119,"titleName":"Postmodern Metanarratives: Blade Runner and Literature in the Age of Image","titleSort":"postmodern metanarratives: blade runner and literature in the age of image","titleURL":"Postmodern-Metanarratives-Blade-Runner-And-Literature-In-The-Age-Of-Image","authorFirstName":"Décio Torres","authorLastName":"Cruz","publicationDate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","imageName":"https://philipdick.com/images/covers/PostmodernMetanarratives.jpg","categoryID":4,"shortDescription":"Postmodern Metanarratives investigates the relationship between cinema and literature by analyzing the film Blade Runner as a postmodern work that constitutes a landmark of cyberpunk narrative and establishes a link between tradition and the (post)modern.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-28T00:35:27.388Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T00:35:27.388Z","category":{"categoryID":4,"category":"Secondary Resources","sortID":4,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":192,"titleName":"Precious Artifacts 2: A Philip K.

But when they began to imitate their creators, it was time for the human race to make peace--if it could!\" Philip K.

Unless we can individually and collectively be certain of the answer to this question, we face what is, in my view, the most serious problem possible. Without answering it adequately, we cannot even be certain of our own selves.\" Reviewing the story, critic Zack Handlen wrote, \"'Second Variety' is grim, violent, and suspenseful. . . . While most of the twists are easy to spot once you discover the main plot--basically 'Are you or aren't you a machine'-- they still have an impact, and Dick makes his point quite clearly.\" Besides the title story, this collection also includes nine more classic Philip K.

In “Autofac,” one community must battle benign machines to take back control of their lives. And in “I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon,” we follow the story of one man whose very reality may be nothing more than a nightmare.

Dick is to the second half.”—Art Spiegelman, author of MAUS\n\nPhilip K. Dick was both our most brilliant science fiction writer and a visionary philosopher who chose to couch his speculations in fiction. For, as he wrote about androids and virtual reality, schizophrenic prophets and amnesiac gods, Dick was also posing fundamental questions: What is reality? What is sanity? And what is human? This unprecedented collection of Dick’s literary and philosophical writings acquaints us with the astonishing range and eloquence of his lifelong inquiry.\n\nThe Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick includes autobiography, critiques of science fiction, and dizzyingly provocative essays such as “The Android and the Human” and “If You Find This World Bad, You Should See Some of the Others.” Readers will also find two chapters of a proposed sequel to Dick’s award-winning novel The Man in the High Castle and selections from the metaphysical Exegesis that inspired his classic VALIS.\n\nWitty, erudite, and exploding with intellectual shrapnel, this is the last testament of an American original. This collection confirms Dick’s reputation as one of the foremost imaginative thinkers of the twentieth century.\n\n“A wide-ranging selection of free-wheeling philosophical essays, and journal entries; humorous, thoughtful speeches; and plot scenarios. . . .

As one of Dick’s final works, it also provides unique insight into the mind of a genius, whose work was still in the process of maturing at the time of his death.","urlPKDweb":"https://1999pkdweb.philipdick.com/TIMOTHY%20ARCHER.htm","active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:31.269Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T21:26:42.456Z","category":{"categoryID":1,"category":"Novels","sortID":1,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":249,"titleName":"The Truman Show","titleSort":"truman show, the","titleURL":"The-Truman-Show","authorFirstName":null,"authorLastName":null,"publicationDate":"1998-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","imageName":"https://philipdick.com/images/covers/TheTrumanShow.jpg","categoryID":6,"shortDescription":"Truman doesn’t realize that his quaint hometown is a giant studio set run by a visionary producer/director/creator (Ed Harris), that folks living and working there are Hollywood actors, that even his incessantly bubbly wife is a contract player.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-11-10T02:51:55.354Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-10T02:51:55.354Z","category":{"categoryID":6,"category":"Film","sortID":6,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":124,"titleName":"The Twisted Worlds of Philip K.

Dick (1928–1982) single-handedly reshaped twentieth-century science fiction. His influence has only increased since his death with the release of numerous feature films based on his work, including Blade Runner (based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?), Total Recall (based on \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\"), Minority Report (based on \"The Minority Report\"), and Next (based on \"The Golden Man\"). In Understanding Philip K. Dick, Eric Carl Link introduces readers to the life, career, and work of this groundbreaking, prolific, and immeasurably influential force in American literature, media culture, and contemporary science fiction.\n\nDick was at times a postmodernist, a mainstream writer, a pulp fiction writer, and often all three simultaneously, but as Link illustrates, he was more than anything else a novelist of ideas. From this vantage point, Link surveys Dick's own tragicomic biography, his craft and career, and the recurrent ideas and themes that give shape and significance to his fiction. Link addresses Dick's efforts to break into the mainstream in the 1950s, his return to science fiction in the 1960s, and his move toward more theologically oriented work in his final two decades. Link finds across Dick's writing career an intellectual curiosity that transformed his science fiction novels from bizarre pulp extravaganzas into philosophically challenging explorations of the very nature of reality, and it is this depth of vision that continues to garner new audiences and fresh approaches to Dick's genre-defining tales.","urlPKDweb":null,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-28T01:36:55.778Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-29T14:33:14.589Z","category":{"categoryID":14,"category":"Biographies","sortID":14,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-29T14:25:59.128Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-29T14:25:59.128Z"}},{"titleID":49,"titleName":"The Unreconstructed M and Other Stories","titleSort":"unreconstructed m and other stories, the","titleURL":"The-Unreconstructed-M-And-Other-Stories","authorFirstName":"Philip K.","authorLastName":"Dick","publicationDate":null,"imageName":"https://philipdick.com/images/covers/TheUnreconstructedMAndOtherStories.jpg","categoryID":2,"shortDescription":"What if...a machine could murder one person while implicating another for the crime?

Philip Kindred Dick was born on December 16 1928, in Chicago, Illinois. Dick and his family moved to the Bay Area of San Francisco when he was young, and later on to Washington Dc following his parents divorce. Dick attended Elementary school and then a Quaker school before the family moved back to California. It was around this time that Dick began to take an active interest in the science fiction genre, reading his first magazine 'Stirring Science Stories', at age twelve. Dick married five times between 1959 and 1973, and had three children. He sold his first story in 1951 and from that point on he wrote full-time, selling his first novel in 1955. In addition to 44 published novels, Dick wrote an estimated 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime.

Like the best of Dick's novels, these stories offer a wide variety of narrative and intellectual pleasures, and provide an ideal introduction to one of the singular imaginations of the modern era.","urlPKDweb":"","active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:31.269Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-26T23:38:41.520Z","category":{"categoryID":2,"category":"Short Story Collections","sortID":2,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":53,"titleName":"Volume IV: The Minority Report (The Collected Stories of Philip K.

This generous collection contains 18 stories and novellas written between 1954 and 1963, years in which Dick produced some of his most memorable work, including such novels as Martian Time Slip and the Hugo Award-winning The Man in the High Castle. Included here are 'Autofac,' a post-apocalyptic tale in which humans share the devastated Earth with the machines they have created but no longer fully control; 'The Mold of Yancy,' a portrait of a world reduced to bland conformity by the vapid--and ubiquitous--pronouncements of a virtual demagogue; and 'The Days of Perky Pat,' another post-apocalypse story in which Earth s survivors find temporary solace in the Perky Pat game, a game rooted in the images and memories of a world that no longer exists. Finally, the classic title story, filmed by Steven Spielberg as Minority Report, posits a future state in which the 'Precrime' bureau, aided by a trio of pre-cognitive mutants, arrests and incarcerates 'criminals' for crimes they have not yet committed. Like its predecessors, this extraordinary volume is a treasure house of story, offering narrative pleasures and intellectual excitement in equal measure.","urlPKDweb":"","active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:31.269Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-26T23:49:28.296Z","category":{"categoryID":2,"category":"Short Story Collections","sortID":2,"active":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T03:10:19.256Z"}},{"titleID":54,"titleName":"Volume V: We Can Remember It for You Wholesale (The Collected Stories of Philip K.

Among the many pleasures included here are the classic title story (filmed twice as Total Recall), in which an ordinary clerk, awash in resurrected memories, discovers the truth about his past and about the astonishing role he has played in human history; the Hugo-nominated ''Faith of Our Fathers,'' with its bleak and controversial vision of a predatory deity; and ''The Electric Ant,'' a brilliant embodiment of a classic Dick theme: the elusive--and changeable--nature of what we believe to be ''real.''

The best of these stories, like the best of Dick's novels, are richly imagined, deeply personal visions that no one else could have written.

In November of 1982, six months before the author's death, journalist Gwen Lee recorded the first of several in-depth discussions with Philip K.
